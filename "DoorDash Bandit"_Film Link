PROPOSAL

I intend to create a 3-5 minute (roughly 4 minute) short film that is geared to be received comedically.
I like to draw influence from Saturday Night Live sketches with regards to the film cuts and compositions, 
and a few Wayans Brothers films with regards to the acting and screenwriting elements. I believe that my approach
to this blends the two together, while keeping the humor fun, engaging, and current so that it can be digested and
easily followed by peers near my age range. Most of the shots will be framed as MCU or CU to drastically juxtapose
the characters’ headspace and biased perspective, which is where most of the humor is rooted in this film’s writing. 

The historical background for the story is set in present-day, and is based on a Doordash Driver, JAKE, who has
a fancy for “stealing” his customers’ food. 

The project and film props will be funded/provided by the production team.
